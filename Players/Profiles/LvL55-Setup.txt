ATTENTION!!! Different versions of the game encrypt the file differently.
Not all mpdata files are the same. Only the universal LvL55 file works here!
It is included next to this file.

- Exit game.
- Remove all mod folders inside your player profile folder.
- Everywhere in Windows registry search for "codkey" and set its value to that of LvL55.
- In your profile folder replace the mpdata file with that of LvL55.
- Run the game and check your rank. You should now be LvL55.
- Now in game options enter your original cod key.
- Play a game online for the changes to persist.
